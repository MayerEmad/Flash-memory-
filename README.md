In this project, I used C, C++ to make a flash memory program

In this project, User can\
-read Files.\
-Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete Files & Folders.\
-Move next and back like we do on the computer.\
-Save Data To the Disk (so when we close the program and run it later we can go to data we saved).\
-Load Data from the Disk (the data we saved before).\
-Show Folders components and size.\
I used: **Linked_list**, **pointers**, **DFS & BFS** algorithms.

For me, I love this project because it was my first time to use C++ out of Problem Solving especially **Depth_First_Search and Breadth_First_Search Algorithms** To handle the paths of files and folders. It was really funny To make this Project.
